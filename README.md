### Example MAchine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) Documents

Within this repository, members of the Metadata Standards Sub-Team shall track
examples of [MARC Documents](https://www.loc.gov/marc/faq.html#definition) which shall be used for 
testing importation and the extraction of metadata within ArchivesSpace.

This repository is structured with directories at the root path, each of which 
contains a collection of MARCs from a participating institution or organization.
